    "\n",
    "Since schools cost tens of thousands of dollars to attend, the cost-to-attend trait is always a much bigger *number* than most other traits.  That makes it affect the dissimilarity a lot more than other traits.  Two schools that differ in cost-to-attend by \\$900, but are otherwise identical, get a dissimilarity of 900.  But two schools that differ in graduation rate by .9 (a huge difference!), but are otherwise identical1, get a dissimilarity of only .9.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to fix this problem is to assign different \"weights\" to different traits.  For example, we could fix the problem above by multiplying the difference in the cost-to-attend traits by .001, so that a difference of 900 dollars in cost-to-attend results in a dissimilarity of 900 dollars times .001, or $.9$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a revised method that does that for every trait:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each trait, subtract the two schools' trait values.\n",
    "2. Then take the absolute value of that difference.\n",
    "3. *Now multiply that absolute value by a trait-specific number, like .001 or 2.*\n",

These are loaded into an array called `weights` in the cell below.  `weights.item(0)` is the weight for the first trait, `weights.item(1)` is the weight for the second trait, and so on.  Use the revised method to compute a revised dissimilarity between Berkeley and Stanford.\n",

Which sound you hear depends on how quickly the pressure goes up and down.  Simple, repeated oscillations sound like single musical *notes* to humans.  If the pressure goes up and down 220 times per second, you hear a note musicians call \"A below middle C\".\n",

    "**Question 4.** Create the pressure data for a sound that oscillates 277 times per second, calling it `c_sharp_pressures`, and a sound that oscillates 330 times per second, calling it `e_pressures`.  Add both of those arrays to `a_pressures`, producing an array called `chord_pressures`.  Then create a sound from that data, called `chord_sound`, and play it.  It's called an A-major chord."
