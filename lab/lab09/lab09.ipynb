    "## 1. Histogram Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms show the distribution of a single quantitative variable, where the values of the variable are located on the x-axis and the density or count is placed on the y-axis. The width of each bar is defined by the size of the bins [A, B) where the value A is included in the bin but B is not. Given the properties of histograms, we cannot determine the distribution of data within a specific bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, we are used to using the count scale on the y-axis, which shows the number of values within a bin. However, the issue with this is that charts become misleading once bins have different widths, so we will use the *density* scale, measured in \"percent per unit\", which shows us the number of values within a bin. This allows us to meet the two defining characteristics of a histogram:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Bins are drawn to scale and are contiguous, though some might be empty, because the values on the horizontal axis are numerical\n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "2) The **area** of each bar is proportional to the number of entries in the bin. So, assuming we add all of the bars in a histogram together, the total area is 100%, or in terms of proportions, the areas of all of the bars will sum to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, under those properties, the **area of a bar = percent of entries in bin = height of bar * width of bin.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing some algebra, we find that **height of the bar = area of bar / width of bin = percent of entries in bin / width of bin** which gives us the density.\n",
