    "## Juries in Alameda County\n",
    "Under the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution, you are guaranteed the right to trial by a jury of your peers in a criminal trial. However - if your jury does not represent the true makeup of your community, is it a fair trial? The Supreme Court explored this question in the case Swain v. Alabama, in which a Black man named Robert Swain was convicted of raping a white woman and sentenced to death. However, in Mr. Swain's case, he was convicted by an all-white jury, despite 26% of Talladega County (where the trial occurred) being Black. If you're interested in reading more, you can check out the wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swain_v._Alabama) and our textbook chapter on it [here](https://data-8r.gitbooks.io/textbook/chapters/08/1/jury-selection.html). \n",

They found the following (where blue bars represent the proportion of eligible jurors in the county and the yellow bar represents the proportion of those who actually served in juries)."
